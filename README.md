# typescript-jest

This project implements a `merge` function in TypeScript, along with Jest unit tests. The `merge` function takes three arrays as input and merges them into a single sorted array.

```typescript
merge(collection_1: number[], collection_2: number[], collection_3: number[]): number[]
```
### Input Requirements
* collection_1 and collection_2 are already sorted in ascending order from minimum (0) to maximum.
* collection_3 is sorted in descending order from maximum to minimum.
